# AnimalClassificationModel
Develop Computer Vision code for integration into app under develop to be used in the operations of a farm. Initially this code will be stand alone but will latter be integrated into larger project. The routines are to function in two ways. First on a mobile iOS device the user can take a picture of an animal. The animal will be identified with via AI or via tag and the AI vision will estimate weight and health of the animal. The code is to able be enabled to grab pictures from a network of cameras and similarly identify, weigh and analyze health.  A subsequent project to follow will provide similar functions but in the analysts of tree crops. (Avocado, line, coffee, etc).
----------------
To develop a Computer Vision code for integration into a farm management app that performs animal identification, weight estimation, and health analysis, we need to break down the task into the following major components:

    Animal Identification: Use AI-based models to identify different animals from images (e.g., using a pre-trained CNN model for classification or a custom-trained model for specific animals).
    Weight Estimation: Use a regression model or similar methods to estimate the weight of the animal based on features visible in the image (e.g., size, body shape).
    Health Analysis: This will likely involve detecting visible signs of health (e.g., injuries, skin condition, etc.) using image processing techniques or further trained models for health diagnostics.
    Integration with Networked Cameras: The ability to process images captured by cameras installed on the farm (real-time or batch processing).
    Mobile App Integration: Integration with a mobile iOS app (using libraries like CoreML for on-device inference) to allow users to capture images and analyze them directly on their devices.

Required Libraries & Tools:

    TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch: For building AI-based models.
    OpenCV: For image processing tasks (e.g., feature extraction, resizing, etc.).
    CoreML (for iOS): To convert trained models into a format that can run on iOS devices.
    Flask or FastAPI: For serving models via a backend API.
    Mobile frameworks: For integrating this functionality into the iOS app.

Approach

    Step 1: Animal Identification
        Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet for animal classification.
        You can fine-tune a model based on your own dataset of farm animals.

    Step 2: Weight Estimation
        Regression Model: Once the animal is identified, we can use a regression model that estimates weight based on visible features (e.g., size, body dimensions).
        You might need a labeled dataset where weight and features of animals are correlated.

    Step 3: Health Analysis
        Use Object Detection or Semantic Segmentation to detect health-related features like wounds, injuries, or other visible conditions.
        This can be achieved using pre-trained object detection models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or Mask R-CNN.

    Step 4: Real-Time Camera Integration
        Capture images from farm cameras via a network and process them in batches or real-time.
        Use libraries like OpenCV to process images from cameras and send them to the server for analysis.

    Step 5: Mobile App Integration
        Once the models are trained, convert them to CoreML format for iOS integration. This allows the models to run directly on the mobile device without needing a server.
        Use frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or CoreML for iOS to deploy the models.

Python Code Outline

Below is an outline for the computer vision pipeline that will later be integrated into the app. This assumes you already have or will collect the necessary datasets for animal classification, weight estimation, and health analysis.
1. Animal Classification Model (TensorFlow/Keras Example)

We'll first build a simple CNN model for animal classification. The model will identify animals in an image.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import os

# Set image size and batch size
img_size = (224, 224)
batch_size = 32

# Data augmentation for training
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, 
                                   shear_range=0.2, 
                                   zoom_range=0.2, 
                                   horizontal_flip=True)

test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

# Directories for training and validation data
train_dir = 'data/train'
validation_dir = 'data/validation'

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    train_dir,
    target_size=img_size,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical')

validation_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    validation_dir,
    target_size=img_size,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical')

# Build CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(len(train_generator.class_indices), activation='softmax')  # Number of animal classes
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10, validation_data=validation_generator)

# Save the model
model.save('animal_classification_model.h5')

2. Weight Estimation Model (Simple Regression Example)

Assuming you have data where animal features (e.g., dimensions) and weights are available:

import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Example data (features: body length, width, height; target: weight)
X_train = np.array([[120, 45, 50], [135, 50, 55], [140, 60, 65]])  # Animal features (length, width, height)
y_train = np.array([200, 250, 270])  # Corresponding weights

# Build the regression model
weight_model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, input_dim=3, activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)  # Output: weight of the animal
])

weight_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
weight_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)

# Save the model
weight_model.save('weight_estimation_model.h5')

3. Health Analysis Model (Using YOLO for Object Detection Example)

For health analysis, we can use a pre-trained object detection model like YOLO to detect visible health issues like injuries or wounds.

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO model (use a pre-trained model or fine-tune for animal health issues)
yolo_net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")
layer_names = yolo_net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i - 1] for i in yolo_net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]

# Load image from camera or file
image = cv2.imread('animal_image.jpg')
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)

# Perform inference
yolo_net.setInput(blob)
outs = yolo_net.forward(output_layers)

# Parse results (assumes bounding boxes for health issues like injuries)
for out in outs:
    for detection in out:
        scores = detection[5:]
        class_id = np.argmax(scores)
        confidence = scores[class_id]
        
        if confidence > 0.5:  # Confidence threshold
            # Extract bounding box, display or process health issue
            pass

4. Integration with iOS using CoreML

Once you have trained the models (animal_classification_model.h5, weight_estimation_model.h5, etc.), you can use CoreML to convert these models for use in an iOS app:

# Install CoreML tools (for conversion)
pip install coremltools

import coremltools as ct

# Convert TensorFlow model to CoreML format
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('animal_classification_model.h5')
coreml_model = ct.convert(model)
coreml_model.save('animal_classification.mlmodel')

5. Real-Time Image Capture from Network Cameras

You can use OpenCV to capture images from network cameras (e.g., IP cameras) and process them in real-time.

import cv2

# Connect to network camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('http://<camera-ip>/video_stream')

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Process the frame
    # Call your model prediction functions here

    # Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Conclusion

This is a basic framework for a computer vision system that can be used for animal identification, weight estimation, and health analysis in a farming context. Once trained and optimized, these models can be converted to CoreML for iOS integration or deployed as a backend API.

To integrate this into an app, the app will communicate with the backend (for camera images or network camera feeds) or use the models directly on the device for fast, on-the-spot analysis.
